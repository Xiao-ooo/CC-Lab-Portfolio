# SPEEDY MANDARIN

 This is a tool and a quiz that i created for chinese language beginners. In this website i created a mini basic intro chinese characters and 2 level of quiz that test on what user have learned. 

## Design Process

- Since this is for very basic beginners, i want to make it user friendly and very simple to learn. 
- I thought mandarin = mandarin and thats where this light orangy and yellow color theme started.
- To make the learning more simple, i made them into card and only 8 vocabs at a time. With its massive size, its easy to read and understand. 
- The two level of quiz shows different levels. The first level is basically multiple choice, but i know some people might still get it wrong so i provided a hint if they got their first try wrong and they will have a total of 3 tries. The second level is more advance in spelling the whole pronounciation of the chinese character out. I will give the english definition to it and also hints are provided. 
- And most importantly, you need ATLEAST 65% TO PASS! Making it a little bit more serious but not very strict on it so people have hope and passion. 

## Inspiration & Reference

- My inspiration of this quiz learning came from the chinese school i've been going for 8 years. And also the little kids i've been teaching for years. They are completely ABC [American born Chinese] that does not know a single chinese character, so i want my quiz learning website to be a little bit more easier and its also a way to practice memorizing words and pronounciation.
- I referenced duolingo and quizlet, i am inspired and also think using flip cards is a fun and easy way to learn. You don't see the definition but you have it and you can use it if you need. 


## Challenges 

1. **HTML**:
   - Sorting out the format of every class and the holder for it was a long process and was getting very confusing at first.
   - Getting my own font to work took a long time, did not know what happen but something crashed, and then the space between the fonts don't look good.
   - Sorting the class for each list and item was complicated and confusing
   
   
2. **Coding**:
   - Could not figure out how to get the correct answer at first, need to do some math and same thing with calcuting the percentages
   - The hint was confusing, i want it to appear before switch to next question but it always shows last
   - Sorting and organizng the characters and ID in their own dictionary, need to be very neat took the longest time
   - needed to run this outside first and then taking it into visual code studio, for some reason did not know why some time it glitches

## Next Step

1. **Revision of this Project**:
   - If i had more time with this project, i would add more levels. 
      - For instance: After the basic intro and the 2 level is passed, it will move on to the next journey and so on. Basically there is gonna be some sort of quiz for every chapter.
